# Clustering the Countries by using Unsupervised Learning for HELP International

#### Using Unsupervised Learning Techniques to categorize the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.

*Inspired by this kaggle problem*: https://www.kaggle.com/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data

#### Used Techniques,
 - **K-Means** clustering
 - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** 

These Notebooks contain,
1) K-Means clustering
   - Optimum cluster model evaluation using silhouette scores
   - Cluster visualization on feature pairs
2) Dimensionality reduction & evaluation using PCA
   - Feature similarity from Principal components
   - Clustering (using K-Means) the data with reduced dimensions
